# Guide to Using Portainer GUI with Stacks #

From Portainer on your `Control Node` select the environment for this server and click on the **Stacks** menu item or button. Click on the **Add stack** button and give your stack a name. In the **Web editor** paste the contents of the `docker-compose.yml` file into the editor. After editing the contents of the `.env` file of the stack you're using click on the **Load variables from .env file** button and upload the `.env` file. Click on the **Deploy the stack** button to add this stack and start it.
